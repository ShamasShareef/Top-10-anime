DRY - DONT REPEAT YOURSELF
  - C/P 10 LIST ELEMENTS ISNT DRY

WE HAV JAVASCRIPT FOR DRYNESS
  - SAME SET OF INSTRUCTIONS, DIFFERENT VALUES

Runtime describes software/instructions that are executed while your program is running, 
especially those instructions that you did not write explicitly, 
but are necessary for the proper execution of your code.

where your code is going to run determines how you are going to code 

Browser is run time for front end
Node    is run time for back end



you need to know what the problem is, try to read code to see if working as intended
doing the same thing in a different environment

.env stores variables specific to your environment (like the port number), private variables
git ignore hides things from history 
heroku will run the js file onto their cloud
